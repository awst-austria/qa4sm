        <b>Step 1</b> - Choose the data you would like to validate - including the dataset name, the version of the dataset,
        and one of the soil moisture variables provided in the dataset. More details on the supported datasets can be found
        <a href="{% url 'datasets' %}#data">here</a>.

    <img class="scaled_image mb-3" src="../../static/images/help/data_set_selections.png">
    <p>
        <b>Step 2 [optional]</b> - Choose the criteria by which you would like to filter this dataset.
        The filters available depend on the data contained within the chosen dataset. For example,
        you can filter the C3S data to include only data with no inconsistencies detected (flag = 0).
        Details of the filter options provided for each dataset are given on the supported datasets page
        <a href="{% url 'datasets' %}">here</a>. You can also hover your mouse pointer over the question mark next to a filter
        to get a short explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Step 3 [optional]</b> - If you want to intercompare several datasets, you can add more datasets to the validation
        using the <b>+</b> button, up to a maximum of five. Configure the settings for the additional datasets by selecting
        the respective tab and repeating steps 1 and 2 above.<br/>

    <p class="alert alert-info">
        <b>Intercomparison:</b> The intercomparison mode of QA4SM validates up to five satellite data sets against a common
        reference data set. For each reference location (e.g. each ISMN station) it finds the nearest observation series in
        all selected satellite products.
        All observations series are then scaled (if selected) and temporally matched to the reference series.
        For validation only the common time stamps (that are available in all satellite products) are used to calculate validation metrics
        between the reference and each individual satellite product.
        This way deviations in the metrics due to different temporal coverage are excluded and validation results represent differences in
        the performance of the compared satellite products.
    </p>
    <img class="scaled_image mb-3" src="../../static/images/help/intercomparison.png">
    <p>
        <b>Step 4</b> - Choose the reference dataset you would like to use for the
        validation including the dataset name, the version of the dataset, and the soil moisture variables provided in
        the dataset. More details on the supported datasets can be found <a href="{% url 'datasets' %}#ref">here</a>.
    </p>
    <img class="scaled_image mb-3" src="../../static/images/help/reference_data_set_selections.png">
    <p>
        <b>Step 5 [optional]</b> - Choose the criteria by which you would like to filter the reference data prior to
        running the validation. The filters available depend on the data contained within the chosen dataset. For example,
        you can filter the ISMN data to include only data points where the soil_moisture_flag is &quot;G&quot; for &quot;good&quot;.
        Details of the filter options provided for each dataset are given on the supported datasets page
        <a href="{% url 'datasets' %}">here</a>. You can also hover your mouse pointer over the question mark next to a filter
        to get a short explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Step 6 [optional]</b> - If you want to calculate metrics from anomalies instead of absolute values, select the desired method
        in the &quot;Method&quot; drop-down menu. The options are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not calculate: don't calculate anomalies, use absolute values.</li>
        <li>35 day moving average: calculate the differences between each measurement value and the 35 day moving average around the value.</li>
        <li>Climatology: calculate the differences between each measurement value and the climatology value for that day of the year. The climatology
        is calculated producing an average for each day of the year across the input dataset over the given climatology period. You have to specify
        which years to use for climatology calculation.</li>
    </ul>
    <img class="scaled_image mb-3" src="../../static/images/help/anomalies.png">
    <p>
        <b>Step 7 [optional]</b> - Chose the geographic area over which the validation should be performed. You can either specify a lat/lon bounding
        box directly or you can select the area on a map by clicking the globe button. The trash button will clear all four bounding
        box fields.<br/>
        If you don't specify an area, a global validation will be done.
    </p>
    <img class="scaled_image mb-3" src="../../static/images/help/spatial_subsetting.png">
    <img class="scaled_image mb-3" src="../../static/images/help/map_selection.png">
    <p>
        <b>Step 8 [optional]</b> - Choose the date range over which the validation should be performed. Accepted formats are: YYYY*MM*DD
        or DD*MM*YYYY where * can be any of &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot; or &quot;-&quot;. If you don't provide a period it will be
        implicitly determined through temporal matching of the data and reference selected. For the time range covered by the various
        datasets, see the <a href="{% url 'datasets' %}">datasets page</a>.
    </p>
    <img class="scaled_image mb-3" src="../../static/images/help/validation_period.png">

    <p>
        <b>Step 9 [optional]</b> - Activate Triple Collocation Analysis (TC). By default, QA4SM calculates validation
        metrics between dataset pairs (the reference and each candidate data set). If more than 3 datasets
        are selected (including the reference), the switch to activate TC becomes available. If
        TC is selected, in addition to the basic metrics between dataset pairs, TC metrics between
        triples of selected datasets are calculated. The reference is included in all triples and
        metrics are found for all candidate datasets. Note that each TC metric is specific to a dataset
        (this is evident from the metric name). TC metrics are affected by all 3 used datasets. Only results from TC with
        independent datasets should be used.
    </p>
    <img class="scaled_image mb-3" src="../../static/images/help/tca.png">

    <p>
        <b>Step 10</b> - Choose how the data (or reference) will be scaled before metrics calculation.
        The data can be scaled to the reference (default) or vice versa.
        Note that in an intercomparision validation (with multiple datasets), only scaling to reference
        is possible.
        The scaling method determines how values of one dataset are mapped onto the value range of the
        other dataset for better comparability.
    </p>
    <img class="scaled_image mb-3" src="../../static/images/help/scaling.png">

    <p>
        <b>Step 11</b> - Optionally name your validation results to make it easier to identify it in
        the list of all your validations.
    </p>
    <img class="scaled_image mb-3" src="../../static/images/help/name_your_validation.png">

    <p>
        <b>Step 12</b> - Run the validation process. You'll be notified via e-mail once it's
        finished. You don't need to keep the results window (or even your browser) open for
        the validation to run. The email will contain a link to your results.
