Network Information

	CHINA
		Abstract: Soil moisture datasets for 40 stations were collected from the Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The soil moisture observations were taken using the gravimetric technique and were converted to total soil moisture [cm]. After downloading the measurements from Alan Robock"s "Global Soil Moisture Database" the data was converted into volumetric soil moisture [m^3/m^3]. The dataset provides observations three times a month from 1981 to 1991 in 11 different layers.

	CTP_SMTMN
		Abstract: A dense monitoring network that consists of 56 stations is established on the central Tibetan Plateau to measure two state variables (soil moisture and temperature) at three spatial scales (1.0, 0.3, 0.1 degree) and four soil depths (0~5, 10, 20, and 40 cm). Elevations of these stations vary over 4470~4950 m. The experimental area is characterized by low biomass, high soil moisture dynamic range, and typical freeze-thaw cycle. As auxiliary parameters of this network, soil texture and soil organic carbon content are measured at each station to support further studies. All the sensors have been calibrated by taking account of the impact of soil texture and soil organic carbon content on the measurements. 
As the highest soil moisture network above sea level in the world, this network meets the requirement for evaluating a variety of soil moisture products and for soil moisture scaling analyses. 
Note that, 
a)	some of the stations are shared by two or three sub-scale networks (indicated by the station names) and thus the number of station names is up to 69 in total; 
b)	in order to ensure the continuous measurements of the near surface (0~5 cm) SM/TM, the original surface layer sensor (when get damaged) is usually replaced with another sensor at deeper depth during field maintenance. Therefore there may be offset in a time series before and after the replacing time point (shown in Table 1).

		Abstract: Soil moisture datasets for 44 stations were collected by the National Agency of Meterology, Hydrology and Environment Monitoring in Ulaanbaatar. All observations were taken using the gravimetric technique and initially provided as volumetric plant-available water [%]. Volumetric soil moisture [m^3/m^3] was calculated by first extracting texture properties of all sites from the Harmonized World Soil Database and subsequently calculating the wilting levels for all stations using the equations of Saxton and Rawls (2006). 
Soil moisture measurements are provided three times a month from 1964 to 2002 during the warm period of the year, which runs from April until the end of October.

	RUSWET-AGRO
		Abstract: Soil moisture datasets for 78 districts have been prepared by Vladimir Zabelin from the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, Moscow, Russia. The soil moisture observations were taken using the gravimetric technique and were provided as volumetric plant-available water [%] for the upper 20 cm and 1 m soil layers at agricultural fields. Thus volumetric soil moisture [m^3/m^3] was calculated by first extracting texture properties of all sites from the Harmonized World Soil Database and subsequently calculating the wilting levels for all stations using the equations of Saxton and Rawls (2006).
As this dataset was designed for monitoring of soil moisture at agricultural fields datasets were seperately available for spring cereal crops and winter cereal crops for all locations. In the ISMN stations with the suffix "a" represent spring cereal crops while stations with "b" illustrate winter cereal crops. Measurements are available during the growing period from 1987 to 1988, three times a month.

	RUSWET-GRASS
		Abstract: This network combines the two datasets RUSWET-GRASS-50STA and RUSWET-GRASS-130STA of the Global Soil Moisture Data Bank by Alan Robock and Konstantin Vinnikov. Soil moisture information at 122 meterological stations of the Former Soviet Union were collected. The results of soil moisture gravimetric measurements, which were taken at plots with natural grass type vegetation, were initially provided as volumetric plant-available water [%]. Volumetric soil moisture [m^3/m^3] was calculated by first extracting texture properties of all sites from the Harmonized World Soil Database and subsequently calculating the wilting levels for all stations using the equations of Saxton and Rawls (2006).
For the period 1952 to 1985 soil moisture measurements for the layer 0-100 cm are provided for some stations. Measurements of the upper 10 cm soil layer are available for the period 1977 to 1985.

	RUSWET-VALDAI
		Abstract: Soil moisture datasets for 3 catchments located at the Valdai basin were collected by the State Hydrological Institute in St. Petersburg from 1960 to 1990. The catchments differ in their vegetation, Usadievskiy has mostly grassland vegetation, Tayozhniy a mature forest and Sinaya Gnilka was articifally forested in 1961. 
The soil moisture was computed by using data from 9-11 observational points distributed over the basin area. The resulting files contain monthly means of soil moisture for the layers of 0-20, 0-50 and 0-100 cm. These files were downloaded from the "Global Soil Moisture Database" and transformed into volumetric soil moisture [m^3/m^3]. Thus soil moisture values are available as monthly means, precipitation as monthly totals [mm] and temperature [Â°C] as daily values. Other variables measured but not included into the ISMN are runoff, averaged water table depth, averaged water equivalent snow depth and averaged evaporation.
