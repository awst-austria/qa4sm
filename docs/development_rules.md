## Coding Style

4 spaces instead of tabs.

## Development guidelines

- Try to understand the task: discuss (your) items in detail during the planning meetint and/or before starting; ask questions; if necessary, split the task if it becomes too large.
- Set priorities of your tasks, especially where others' tasks rely on yours.
- Discuss open issues and resulting issues with the team in regular meetings or in chat.
- The master branch in git should always build and pass the tests.
- Work through the “Definition of DONE” before declaring an item finished.

## Definition Of Done

Before you say a backlog item is done, check the following list and make sure you can tick off all points:

* The software fulfills all aspects mentioned in the issue.
* The acceptance criteria are met (if they exist).
* The code is committed to a branch in version control (git).
* Unit tests are written to cover the new code; (ideally all lines, including edge cases and errors)
* Implementation doesn't break existing code, i.e. all unit tests pass.
* The package was tested by downloading it from scratch into a clean build environment and running the tests. (Use a buildserver to make your life easier!)
* Someone else has reviewed the change and verified it.
* The implementation is merged into the main branch of the main repository - e.g. via a pull request.
* Jira issue for the backlog item has been updated with the latest information (comments, status change, reassignment, etc.).
