  <h1 id="intro" class="h1 p-mb-3 font-weight-normal">User Data Upload</h1>

  <p>
    With this new, experimental feature we allow users to ingest (parts of) their own data sets into QA4SM for
    comparison
    and validation with the state-of-the-art products available in the service. Please note that
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Data uploaded into the service is not accessible or downloadable by other users. Your data sets in the graphical
      user
      interface will only appear under your account. Other users cannot see, use or download them!
    </li>
    <li>
      There might be data wipes in the future, making it necessary to re-upload your files
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          We do not yet provide traceability for validation results with uploaded data.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is therefore not yet possible to publish results from validation runs that use uploaded data.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Data upload speed depends on your local internet connection. The correct structure of your data can only be
      evaluated after uploading.
      We therefore encourage you to use small data samples for testing.
    </li>
    <li>
      The amount of data users can upload will be limited at some point. Please get in contact with us if you plan to
      upload large data sets (multiple GB) at
      <a href="mailto: support@qa4sm.eu">support@qa4sm.eu</a>. Otherwise we will delete your data again at some point.
    </li>
    <li>
      The upload feature is in an early stage, if you find any bugs or need help with structuring your files correctly,
      contact us at <a href="mailto: support@qa4sm.eu">support@qa4sm.eu</a>.

  <h2 class="h2 mb-3 font-weight-normal">Option 1: Upload NetCDF4 Image Stacks</h2>
  <p>
    Most Level 3 and Level 4 soil moisture data is usually provided in image format with three data dimensions
    (latitude, longitude, time). Images can be concatenated along the time dimension to create image stacks / data
    cubes.
    From these data cubes, time series can be extracted, which is the basis for our validation algorithm.
  </p>
  <h3 class="h3 mb-3 font-weight-normal">General Requirements</h3>
  <p>
    QA4SM supports image stacks in NetCDF4 format only. NetCDF is the most common format for climate data records and
    detailed CF conventions to create those files exist
    (<a target="_blank" href="https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions">available here</a>).
    In general we use the python library <a target="_blank" href="https://xarray.dev/">xarray</a> to open netCDF files. If your data is
    compatible with xarray, there are only a few more things to consider.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      No specific file name is required when uploading a netcdf stack. The file name will be changed upon uploading
      data. It is however required that filenames have the extension <b>.nc</b> or <b>.nc4</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
      While netCDF also supports data types such as strings, those are not usable by QA4SM. It is required that your
      soil moisture data and the assigned coordinates (see next chapter) are of type
      <b>integer, float or real</b>, or <b>double</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
      All variables, dimensions and attributes in the file should be named using only letters, digits, and underscores.
      Required attributes (see next chapter) are case sensitive.
      Variable names, long names and standard names should not exceed a length of <b>30</b> characters.
    </li>
    <li>
      Only 'coordinate data', i.e. 3-dimensional raster data, are supported as netCDF validation input.
      As data variables must be 3-dimensional, 1 coordinate variable for each dimension (latitude, longitude, time) must
      be present in the file (see <a pageScroll="" [pageScrollDuration]="1" href="#ncdims">this section</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
      Latitude and Longitude coordinates assigned to soil moisture observations must always refer to the WGS84 reference
      system (i.e. Longitudes from -180 to 180 &deg;E, Latitudes between -90 and 90 &deg;N.
    </li>
    <li>
      A file must contain at least one soil moisture variable to use for validation. If a file contains multiple
      variables, one must be selected after uploading the file in the respective dropdown menu.
    </li>
  </ul>


  <a id="ncdims"></a>
  <h3 class="h3 mb-3 font-weight-normal">Required dimensions and dimension attributes</h3>
  <h4 class="h4 mb-3 font-weight-normal">Latitude and Longitude</h4>
  <p>
    Two of the three dimensions in a netCDF image stack refer to the location of a grid cell and assign latitude and
    longitude coordinates. There are two ways to pass coordinates for a grid:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Latitude and longitude can be 1-dimensional coordinate variables, with a dimension of the same name assigned, that
      contain the coordinate values directly (148 longitude values in the following example).
      The coordinates along the two axes then span a 2-dimension grid that contains the information on the location of
      all points. The longitude variable is structured accordingly.
      <table class="p-my-4 variable-table">
        <tr>
          <td><b>Variable</b></td>
          <td colspan="2">lat</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td rowspan="4"><b>Attributes (dimensions)</b></td>
          <td colspan="2">
            lat (lat: 148)
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>standard_name:</td>
          <td>latitude</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>units:</td>
          <td>degrees_north</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>valid_range:</td>
          <td>[-90. 90]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Coordinates [dtype]</b></td>
          <td colspan="2">lat (lat) [float64]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Data / Values</b></td>
          <td colspan="2">[69.88, 69.62, &#8230;, 33.38, 33.1]</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </li>
    <li>
      Alternatively latitude and longitude can also be 2-dimensionsional coordinate variables, which <b>both</b> have
      two dimensions (in x and y direction; different name as the variables)
      assigned that contain the data point locations directly (16*35 data points in the following example). The
      longitude variable is structured accordingly.
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Variable</b></td>
          <td colspan="2"> lat</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td rowspan="4"><b>Attributes (dimensions)</b></td>
          <td colspan="2">
            lat (y: 16, x: 35)
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>standard_name:</td>
          <td>latitude</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>units:</td>
          <td>degrees_north</td>

        <tr>
          <td>valid_range:</td>

          <td><b>Coordinates [dtypes]</b></td>
          <td colspan="2">lat (y, x) [float64] <br> lon (y, x) [float64]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Data / Values</b></td>
          <td colspan="2"> [5.125, 5.375, &#8230;, 13.375, 13.625] <br>
            [5.125, 5.375, &#8230;, 13.375, 13.625] <br>
            <div>&#8942;</div>
            [5.125, 5.375, &#8230;, 13.375, 13.625] <br>
            [5.125, 5.375, &#8230;, 13.375, 13.625]
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Latitude and Longitude coordinate variables must have the unit assigned!
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Longitude</b>: 'units: degrees_east' or one of 'units: degree_east', 'units: degree_E', 'units: degrees_E',
      'units: degreeE', and 'units: degreesE'.
      If no unit is assigned or multiple coordinate variables of that unit are found, the <i>standard_name</i> attribute
      with value 'longitude' also identifies longitude coordinates.
      If no standard name is provided, the <i>axis</i> attribute with value 'X', otherwise the variable names (case
      insensitive) 'longitude' and 'lon' should also work.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Latitude</b>: 'units: degrees_north' or one of 'units: degree_north', 'units: degree_N', 'units: degrees_N',
      'units: degreeN', and 'units: degreesN'.
      If no unit is assigned or multiple coordinate variables of that unit are found, the <i>standard_name</i> attribute
      with value 'latitude' also identifies latitude coordinates.
      If no standard name is provided, the <i>axis</i> attribute with value 'Y', otherwise the variable names (case
      insensitive) 'latitude' and 'lat' should also work.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="h4 mb-3 font-weight-normal">Observation time stamps</h4>
  <p>
    The third dimension in a file refers to the observation time stamp. It is assigned to a 1-dimensional coordinate
    variable <b>time</b> (10 time stamps in the following example)
  </p>
  <p>
    Time coordinates are stored as numeric timestamps. The variable must therefore have a unit attribute assigned like
    <b>&lt;UNIT&gt; since &lt;REF DATE&gt;</b>, e.g. 'Days since 2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00'
    (see also the <a target="_blank" href="http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions#time-coordinate">CF conventions</a>).
    If multiple potential time variables are found, the variable with attribute 'axis: T', the 'standard_name: time' or
    the variable name 'time' identify the time coordinate variable.
    A calendar name should be specified in the attributes but is not required (assumes 'calendar: standard', i.e. mixed
    Gregorian/Julian calendar).
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Variable</b></td>
      <td colspan="2">time</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="4"><b>Attributes (dimensions)</b></td>
      <td colspan="2">
        time (time=10)
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>standard_name:</td>
      <td>time</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>units:</td>
      <td>days since 2019-01-01 00:00:00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>calendar:</td>
      <td>proleptic_gregorian</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><b>Coordinates [dtype]</b></td>
      <td colspan="2">time (time) [datetime64[ns]]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Data / Values</b></td>
      <td colspan="2">['2019-01-01T00:00:00.0', &#8230;, '2019-01-10T00:00:00.0']</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    Often, time stamps cannot be applied globally. In this case the values provided in 'time' is the basis to which a
    time offset is added. The time offset must be given as a separate, 3-dimensional variable (same size as the soil
    moisture data) in **Seconds** (from the global time stamp of the same image).
  </p>

  <h3 class="h3 mb-3 font-weight-normal">Optional variable attributes</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Compression and packing is handled by xarray and controlled by (optional) variable encoding attributes
      'add_offset', 'scale_factor', 'zlib' and 'complevel'. For more details on compressing netCDF files see
      <a target="_blank" href="http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions#_reduction_of_dataset_size">this chapter</a> in
      the CF conventions.
    </li>
    <li>
      The (physical) valid range of a variable (for SM usually 0-100 or 0-1) should be identified by the variable
      attributes 'valid_range' resp. 'valid_min' and 'valid_max'.
      Values outside if this range will be treated as invalid.
    </li>
    <li>
      While it is technically not necessary, it is highly recommended that all variables in a file have units assigned
      (as the variable attribute 'units'). QA4SM may use these units in e.g. plots.
    </li>
    <li>
      Data variables in the file should have a 'long_name' and/or 'standard_name' attribute. The name given under
      'long_name' will be used in plots. If no 'long_name' is given, but a 'standard_name'
      (see <a target="_blank" href="http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html">this
      table</a> for all possible standard names),
      this will be used. If neither 'long_name' nor 'standard_name' attributes exist, the variable name will be used
      directly.
    </li>
  </ul>


  <a id="csvfiles"></a>
  <h2 class="h2 mb-3 font-weight-normal">Option 2: Upload Time Series</h2>

  <p>
    As a more flexible way of providing data (which requires some pre-processing on the user side), we also allow
    uploading a collection of individual time series stored in <b>.csv</b> format.
    This is especially useful for datasets with non-orthogonal time steps (i.e. different time stamps at different
    locations) and to reduce the amount of uploaded data
    (as e.g. only time series at in situ locations can be extracted beforehand). This data can be uploaded to QA4SM as a
    <b>zip achive</b> of individual time series stored in a separate CSV file for each location.
    The location metadata (latitude, longitude, unique grid point index) has to be included in the individual file
    names. Dataset wide metadata (units, variable names) are provided in a <b>yaml</b> file in the
    same zip archive.
  </p>

  <h3 class="h3 mb-3 font-weight-normal">File name conventions</h3>
  <p>
    The file name of an individual CSV file in the zip archive must match the following pattern:
  </p>

  <div><i><b>&lt;DATASET_NAME&gt;</b>_gpi=<b>&lt;GPI&gt;</b>_lat=<b>&lt;LAT&gt;</b>_lon=<b>&lt;LON&gt;</b>.csv</i></div>
  <p>
    with:
  <p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><b>&lt;DATASET_NAME&gt;</b></td>
      <td>The name of the dataset (same for all files)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>&lt;GPI&gt;</b></td>
      <td>a unique grid point index for the location / file</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>&lt;LAT&gt;</b></td>
      <td>latitude in &degN (between -90 and 90 &deg;N) as a floating point number</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>&lt;LON&gt;</b></td>
      <td>longitude in &deg;E (between -180 and 180 &deg;E) as a floating point number</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    E.g. the filename for a data set called 'myDataset' for a single point (ID: 000001) at the location at Latitude
    38.887 &deg;N, Longitude 101.043 &deg;W would be:
  </p>
  <div><i>myDataset_gpi=000001_lat=38.887_lon=-101.043.csv</i></div>

  <h3 class="h3 mb-3 font-weight-normal">File format</h3>
  <p>
    All CSV files must follow the same format, which consists of
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A header row containing column names (must be the same for all files).
    </li>
    <li>
      A date index column in a format that dateutil can parse (see <a target="_blank"
      href="https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parser.html">here</a> for more info).
    </li>
    <li>
      A variable number of data columns (same number of columns for all files).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Below is an example for the contents of a single csv time series file containing values for one soil moisture variable:
  </p>
  <div class="yml">
      Time,SM<br>
      01-Jun-2016 01:30:07,0.18278<br>
      02-Jun-2016 00:51:39,0.2003<br>
      02-Jun-2016 12:08:07,0.181<br>
      04-Jun-2016 01:13:32,0.22323<br>
      &nbsp;&#8942;<br>
  </div>

  <p>
    To test whether a file complies with the required format, you can try to read it in python with <a target="_blank"
    href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>.
    <b>&lt;FNAME&gt;</b> refers to the location of the CSV file in the following example:
  </p>
  <div><i>pandas.read_csv(<b>&lt;FNAME&gt;</b>, index_col=0, parse_dates=True)</i></div>

  <h3 class="h3 mb-3 font-weight-normal">Metadata</h3>
  <p>
    Metadata for the individual data variables (columns) in the CSV files (e.g. units, long name) can be provided in an
    additional file with the name
    'metadata.yml' alongside the CSV files (stored in the same zip archive). This should have a similar format to this
    example for a 'metadata.yml' file:
  </p>
  <div class="yml">
    SM:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; long_name: soil moisture <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; units: m^3/m^3<br>
    &nbsp;&#8942;<br>
    myvarnameX:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; long_name: soil moisture x<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; units: m^3/m^3<br>
  </div>

  <h3 class="h3 mb-3 font-weight-normal">Upload format</h3>
  <p>
    All CSV files and optionally the metadata file have to be in the same directory. This directory has to be uploaded
    as zip file.
  </p>
