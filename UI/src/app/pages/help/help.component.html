  <p>
    The validate page is subdivided into areas for the various validation parameters. Each area has
    menu with two icons on the top right. Hover over the question mark to get help for the respective areas. You can
    use the +/- icon to fold up or fold down the area.

  <p>
    <b>Step 1</b> - Choose the data you would like to validate - including the dataset name, the version of the dataset,
    and one of the soil moisture variables provided in the dataset. All the supported datasets are listed on
    <a routerLink="/datasets" target="_blank">datasets page here</a>. Plase note,
    that there have to be at least two datasets added, as one of them will be treated as the reference one.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="dataset selection" class="scaled_image" [src]="datasetSelections">
  </div>
  <p>
    <b>Step 2 [optional]</b> - Choose the criteria by which you would like to filter this dataset.
    The filters available depend on the data contained within the chosen dataset. For example,
    you can filter the C3S data to include only data with variable in valid geophysical range.
    Details of the filter options provided for each dataset are given on the
    <a routerLink="/datasets" target="_blank">supported datasets page</a>. You
    can also
    hover your mouse pointer over the question mark next to a filter to get a short explanation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Step 3 [optional]</b> - If you want to intercompare several datasets, you can add more datasets to the validation
    using the <b>Add dataset</b> button, up to a maximum of six. Configure the settings for the additional datasets by
    selecting
    the respective tab and repeating steps 1 and 2 above.<br/>
  </p>
  <p class="alert alert-info">
    <b>Intercomparison:</b> The intercomparison mode of QA4SM validates up to six satellite data sets against a common
    spatial reference data set. For each reference location (e.g. each ISMN station) it finds the nearest observation
    series in
    all selected satellite products.
    All observations series are then scaled (if selected) and temporally matched to the temporal reference series.
    For validation only the common time stamps (that are available in all satellite products) are used to calculate
    validation metrics
    between the reference and each individual satellite product.
    This way deviations in the metrics due to different temporal coverage are excluded and validation results represent
    differences in
    the performance of the compared satellite products.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="intercomparison" class="scaled_image" [src]="intercomparison">
  </div>
  <p>
    <b>Step 4</b> - Choose which dataset selected for validation should be used as the spatial and temporal reference.
    Please note, that if the ISMN dataset belongs to the pool, it is set as the spatial reference automatically and
    there
    is no possibility of changing it.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="reference dataset" class="scaled_image" [src]="referenceDatasetSelection">
  </div>
  <p>
    <b>Step 5 [optional]</b> -
    <span>
    If the ISMN belongs to the dataset pool you can also choose specific networks and/or measurements in a defined depth range.
    To do that you have to open an appropriate window by clicking a 'select...' link next to the filter you want to parameterised.
    </span>
  </p>
  <img alt='ismn networks' class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="ismnNetworks">
  <p>
    The window for choosing networks contains a list of continents. When clicking an arrow next to a continent name a
    list of networks that belong to the continent unfolds.
    Next to each network there is the name of the country it belongs to. To toggle the particular network it is enough
    to click on its name.
    The choice doesn't have to be approved, it is enough to close the dialog window and the choice will be saved.
  </p>
  <img alt="ismn depths" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="ismnDepths">
  <p>
    <span>
    The window for the depth selection contains two fields for introducing the depth range. Values have to be introduced in meters.
    The choice can to be accepted by clicking the 'OK' button or simply by closing the dialog window.
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Details of the filter options provided for each dataset are given on the supported datasets page
    <a routerLink="/datasets">here</a>. You can also hover your mouse pointer over the question mark next to a filter
    to get a short explanation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Step 6 [optional]</b> - If you want to calculate metrics from anomalies instead of absolute values, select the
    desired method
    in the &quot;Method&quot; drop-down menu. The options are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not calculate: don't calculate anomalies, use absolute values.</li>
    <li>35 day moving average: calculate the differences between each measurement value and the 35 day moving average
      around the value.
    </li>
    <li>Climatology: calculate the differences between each measurement value and the climatology value for that day of
      the year. The climatology
      is calculated producing an average for each day of the year across the input dataset over the given climatology
      period. You have to specify
      which years to use for climatology calculation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div>
    <img alt="anomalies" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="anomalies">
  </div>
  <p>
    <b>Step 7 [optional]</b> - Chose the geographic area over which the validation should be performed. You can either
    specify a lat/lon bounding
    box directly or you can select the area on a map. The trash button will clear all four
    bounding
    box fields.<br/>
    If you don't specify an area, a global validation will be done.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="spatial subsetting" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="spatialSubsetting">
    <img alt="map selection" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="mapSelection">
  </div>
  <p>
    <b>Step 8 [optional]</b> - Choose the date range over which the validation should be performed and temporal matching
    window size.
    The only accepted date format for the validation period is: YYYY-MM-DD. It is also possible to choose a date from
    a calendar, available when clicking the date input field. By default, the date range is determined through temporal
    matching of the data and reference selected.
    If the validation period fields are left empty, the validation will not be started. For the time range covered by
    the various
    datasets, see the <a routerLink="/datasets" target="_blank">datasets page</a>.
    <br>

    For temporal matching window size, the default (and recommended) value is 12 hours and possible choices are integer
    numbers between 1 and 24 hours.

  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="validation period" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="temporalSubsetting">
  </div>
  <p>
    <b>Step 9 [optional]</b> - Activate Triple Collocation Analysis (TC) and Bootstrapping Triple Collocation confidence
    intervals (BTC). By default, QA4SM calculates validation
    metrics between dataset pairs (the reference and each candidate data set). If more than 3 datasets
    are selected (including the reference), the switch to activate TC becomes available. If
    TC is selected, in addition to the basic metrics between dataset pairs, TC metrics between
    triples of selected datasets are calculated. The reference is included in all triples and
    metrics are found for all candidate datasets. Note that each TC metric is specific to a dataset
    (this is evident from the metric name). TC metrics are affected by all 3 used datasets. Only results from TC with
    independent datasets should be used. <br><br>
    The bootstrapping option is enabled only if TC is selected.
    When it is chosen confidence intervals are calculated via bootstrapping with 1000 repetitions, however the
    validation time might be up to 5 times longer.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="triple collocation" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="tca">
  </div>

  <p>
    <b>Step 10</b> - Choose how the data will be scaled before metrics calculation.
    The data can be scaled to any dataset selected for validation.

    The scaling method determines how values of one dataset are mapped onto the value range of the
    other dataset for better comparability.

    Note that if the chosen method is 'No scaling', there is no scaling reference drop down list available.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="scaling" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="scaling">
  </div>

  <p>
    <b>Step 11</b> - Optionally name your validation results to make it easier to identify it in
    the list of all your validations.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="name your validation" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="nameYourValidation">

  <p>
    <b>Step 12</b> - Run the validation process. You'll be notified via e-mail once it's
    finished. You don't need to keep the results window (or even your browser) open for
    the validation to run. The email will contain a link to your results.

  <p>
    With the QA4SM version 2.1 (and later) it is possible to compare existing validations that belong to the currently
    logged-in user or have been published.
    The comparison module is available for a logged-in user under the “Compare validations” button in the navigation
    bar.
  </p>
  <p>
    The module enables two comparison modes - a comparison of two validations with the same reference data set and
    one non-reference dataset or a comparison between two non-reference datasets used in one validation. The module
    consists of three main components: Dataset Configuration, Validations selection and Spatial extent (see pictures
    below).

  </p>
  <p>
    The Datasets configuration component enables choosing the dataset that was used as the reference one
    (including its version and the variable name) and selecting the comparison mode. Checking ‘Multiple non-reference
    datasets’ switches on the ‘one validation’ comparison mode.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="datest-configuration" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="datsetConfigurationComparison">
  </div>
  <p>
    The Validations selection component gets updated with every change of the reference dataset and shows validations
    available for comparison. A selected validation has to be added by clicking the ‘Add validation’ button.
    If the maximum number of validations has been added, the ‘Add validation’ button gets disabled. Added validations
    are listed below the selection box as red ‘Remove validation’ buttons. Clicking a remove button will remove the
    appropriate validation from the list.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="validation-selection" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="validationSelectionsComparison">

  <p>
    In general it is possible to compare any two validations that have the same reference dataset.
    If additionally the two validations have a common spatial extent, a user can choose if the comparison should be
    performed on all points or only on the common ones. If validations have no common points, the option
    ‘Include all points...’ is disabled.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="spatial-extent" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="spatialExtentComparison">
  </div>
  <p>
    The comparison is started by clicking the ‘Compare’ button. As a result users get four components:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Comparison summary containing summaries, of chosen validations or validation (if ‘one validation’ mode was used);
    </li>
    <li>
      Selected comparison extent containing a plot with marked area for which comparison was performed;
    </li>
    <li>
      Comparison statistics containing a table of validation statistics calculated for both validations and differences
      between them;
    </li>
    <li>
      Comparison plots containing:
      <ul>
        <li>
          a drop down list for metric selection,
        </li>
        <li>
          a box plot depicting particular metric for each validation (if there is no common
          spatial extent between compared validations or if ‘Include all points from the selected validations’ option
          was
          chosen),
        </li>
        <li>
          or a box plot depicting particular metric for each validation and the difference between them, a map depicting
          differences between the chosen metric on all points for which the comparison was performed
          (if there was a common spatial extent between validations).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    All the plots and the statistics table can be downloaded using appropriate buttons placed next to each object.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note, that since the comparison module is still being developed and the comparison is done on the fly,
    there is a risk that a particular comparison may not be performed due to too big validation results file.
    If that is the case the user is advised to run smaller (in terms of spatial subsetting) validations and compare them
    one more time.

  <h1 class="h3 mb-3 font-weight-normal">User Data Upload Procedure</h1>
  <p>
    To upload your go to 'My datasets' page, by clicking proper button on the navigation bar.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="select-file" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="selectFile">
  </div>
  <p>
    Click the 'Select file' button, and then choose 'Add file' to add the file you want to upload. Note, that you'll be
    able
    to choose only .netCDF or .zip files, both types need to follow the standard described
    <a target="_blank" [routerLink]="['/user-data-guidelines']">here.</a> If the .zip file you are trying to upload
    contains
    other types of files than .netCDF, .csv or .yml, you will not be able to upload the file. Please note, that you have
    <b> 5GB </b>
    space available for your files. In case you need more, please contact our team.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="select-file" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="uploadFileWindow">
  </div>
  <p>
    When you choose proper file, a form for providing metadata will show up. You need to provide dataset and version
    names.
    Additionally you can introduce display names for both dataset and its version, which is going to be used on the list
    of available datasets.
    If the display name is not provided, the basic name is going to be used.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="select-file" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="metadataWindow">
  </div>
  <p>
    If you want to change file, you can do it by clicking 'Change file' button. If you want to save provided
    information, click 'Save' button.
    Clicking 'Save' button will close the metadata form, but won't start uploading yet. To start uploading, click the
    'Upload file' button.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="select-file" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="chosenFile">
  </div>
  <p>
    Depending on the file size and your upload speed it may take from few seconds up to tens of minutes. You will see a
    blue spinner and information
    about the percentage of uploaded file. Eventually an information will show up that the file has been uploaded, but
    it still needs to be pre-processed.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="select-file" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="uploadingSpinner">
  </div>
  <p>
    When the file gets uploaded and preprocessed, there will show up a row with basic information on the uploaded file.
    You'll be able to change the dataset's name, the version's name and choose a different variable, if the default one
    is inproper or we were not able to retrieve the proper name.
    By clicking 'Remove dataset' button, you will remove the uploaded file. Note, that removing is possible only if the
    uploaded data
    hasn't been used for any validation.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="select-file" class="scaled_image mb-3" style="scale: 1.2" [src]="dataRow">
  </div>

  <p>If you want to use your dataset in a validation, simply go to the Validate page and expand the dataset dropdown
    list. Your dataset will be there.</p>
  <div>
    <img alt="select-file" class="scaled_image mb-3" style="scale: 0.9" [src]="userDataOnTheList">
  </div>
  <p>
    Now you can choose other settings and run a validation. Note that for now it is not possible to publish validation
    that uses private data.
    You can still share your validation with another user, but they won't be able to rerun it, as they don't have access
    to your dataset.
