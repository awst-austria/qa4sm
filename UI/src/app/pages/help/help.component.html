      <b>Step 1</b> - Choose the data you would like to validate - including the dataset name, the version of the dataset,
      and one of the soil moisture variables provided in the dataset. All the supported datasets are listed on
      <a routerLink="/datasets" target="_blank">datasets page here</a>. Plase note,
      that there have to be at least two datasets added, as one of them will be treated as the reference one.

    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Step 2 [optional]</b> - Choose the criteria by which you would like to filter this dataset.
      The filters available depend on the data contained within the chosen dataset. For example,
      you can filter the C3S data to include only data with variable in valid geophysical range.
      Details of the filter options provided for each dataset are given on the
      <a routerLink="/datasets" target="_blank">supported datasets page</a>. You
      can also
      hover your mouse pointer over the question mark next to a filter to get a short explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Step 3 [optional]</b> - If you want to intercompare several datasets, you can add more datasets to the validation
      using the <b>Add dataset</b> button, up to a maximum of six. Configure the settings for the additional datasets by
      selecting
      the respective tab and repeating steps 1 and 2 above.<br/>

    <p class="alert alert-info">
      <b>Intercomparison:</b> The intercomparison mode of QA4SM validates up to six satellite data sets against a common
      spatial reference data set. For each reference location (e.g. each ISMN station) it finds the nearest observation
      series in
      all selected satellite products.
      All observations series are then scaled (if selected) and temporally matched to the temporal reference series.
      For validation only the common time stamps (that are available in all satellite products) are used to calculate
      validation metrics
      between the reference and each individual satellite product.
      This way deviations in the metrics due to different temporal coverage are excluded and validation results represent
      differences in
      the performance of the compared satellite products.

    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Step 4</b> - Choose which dataset selected for validation should be used as the spatial and temporal reference.
      Please note, that if the ISMN dataset belongs to the pool, it is set as the spatial reference automatically and
      there
      is no possibility of changing it.

      <b>Step 5 [optional]</b> -
      <span>
    If the ISMN belongs to the dataset pool you can also choose specific networks and/or measurements in a defined depth range.
    To do that you have to open an appropriate window by clicking a 'select...' link next to the filter you want to parameterised.

    <p>
      The window for choosing networks contains a list of continents. When clicking an arrow next to a continent name a
      list of networks that belong to the continent unfolds.
      Next to each network there is the name of the country it belongs to. To toggle the particular network it is enough
      to click on its name.
      The choice doesn't have to be approved, it is enough to close the dialog window and the choice will be saved.

    <p>
    <span>
    The window for the depth selection contains two fields for introducing the depth range. Values have to be introduced in meters.
    The choice can to be accepted by clicking the 'OK' button or simply by closing the dialog window.

      to get a short explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Step 6 [optional]</b> - If you want to calculate metrics from anomalies instead of absolute values, select the
      desired method
      in the &quot;Method&quot; drop-down menu. The options are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not calculate: don't calculate anomalies, use absolute values.</li>
      <li>35 day moving average: calculate the differences between each measurement value and the 35 day moving average
        around the value.
      </li>
      <li>Climatology: calculate the differences between each measurement value and the climatology value for that day of
        the year. The climatology
        is calculated producing an average for each day of the year across the input dataset over the given climatology
        period. You have to specify
        which years to use for climatology calculation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>Step 7 [optional]</b> - Chose the geographic area over which the validation should be performed. You can either
      specify a lat/lon bounding
      box directly or you can select the area on a map. The trash button will clear all four
      bounding
      box fields.<br/>
      If you don't specify an area, a global validation will be done.

    </div>
    <p>
      <b>Step 8 [optional]</b> - Choose the date range over which the validation should be performed and temporal matching
      window size.
      The only accepted date format for the validation period is: YYYY-MM-DD. It is also possible to choose a date from
      a calendar, available when clicking the date input field. By default, the date range is determined through temporal
      matching of the data and reference selected.
      If the validation period fields are left empty, the validation will not be started. For the time range covered by
      the various
      datasets, see the <a routerLink="/datasets" target="_blank">datasets page</a>.
      <br>

      For temporal matching window size, the default (and recommended) value is 12 hours and possible choices are integer
      numbers between 1 and 24 hours.

    <p>
      <b>Step 9 [optional]</b> - Activate Triple Collocation Analysis (TC) and Bootstrapping Triple Collocation confidence
      intervals (BTC). By default, QA4SM calculates validation
      metrics between dataset pairs (the reference and each candidate data set). If more than 3 datasets
      are selected (including the reference), the switch to activate TC becomes available. If
      TC is selected, in addition to the basic metrics between dataset pairs, TC metrics between
      triples of selected datasets are calculated. The reference is included in all triples and
      metrics are found for all candidate datasets. Note that each TC metric is specific to a dataset
      (this is evident from the metric name). TC metrics are affected by all 3 used datasets. Only results from TC with
      independent datasets should be used. <br><br>
      The bootstrapping option is enabled only if TC is selected.
      When it is chosen confidence intervals are calculated via bootstrapping with 1000 repetitions, however the
      validation time might be up to 5 times longer.

    </div>

    <p>
      <b>Step 10</b> - Choose how the data will be scaled before metrics calculation.
      The data can be scaled to any dataset selected for validation.

      The scaling method determines how values of one dataset are mapped onto the value range of the
      other dataset for better comparability.

      Note that if the chosen method is 'No scaling', there is no scaling reference drop down list available.

      Once you click the <span class="font-weight-bold">Publish</span> button on the validation result page, you will
      be presented with a dialog
      containing the metadata the results will be published with. You can change the metadata to your liking (within
      some limits) and start the file upload to Zenodo by clicking <span class="font-weight-bold">Publish
        results</span>.<br/>
      Note that we require 'qa4sm' to be one of the keywords, and that Title, Description, Keywords, and
      Name are mandatory fields. You don't need to give an affiliation or
      <a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank" rel="'noreferrer">ORCID</a>, though. Changes you make to your
      author details will <span class="font-weight-bold">not</span> be stored to your user profile - for that, please
      got to the Profile page.<br/>
      The upload can take a few minutes, please be patient. If it should fail, please try
      again a few hours later. If it still doesn't work, please email us at {{ this.getAdminMail() }} and include the
      error message
      you received.

      Please be aware that the NetCDF file and the metadata will be stored at Zenodo under the account of the QA4SM
      project but with your name as the author. Zenodo is a separate website run at CERN over which the QA4SM team
      has no control.<br/>
      <span class="font-weight-bold">Assigning a DOI to a result also means that it cannot easily be unpublished or
        deleted - see also <a href="https://help.zenodo.org/" target="_blank"

      If you prefer to use your own Zenodo account, you can of course do so - the QA4SM publishing feature is just
      for convenience. Just download the NetCDF result file and upload it yourself through Zenodo's submission process
      with your own account. We'd ask you to use 'qa4sm' as one of the keywords so that we can easily find all QA4SM
      results on Zenodo with a keyword search.

    <h1 id="comparison" class="h3 mb-3 font-weight-normal">Validation Comparison</h1>

    <p>
      With the QA4SM version 2.1 (and later) it is possible to compare existing validations that belong to the currently
      logged-in user or have been published.
      The comparison module is available for a logged-in user under the “Compare validations” button in the navigation
      bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The module enables two comparison modes - a comparison of two validations with the same reference data set and
      one non-reference dataset or a comparison between two non-reference datasets used in one validation. The module
      consists of three main components: Dataset Configuration, Validations selection and Spatial extent (see pictures
      below).

    </p>
    <p>
      The Datasets configuration component enables choosing the dataset that was used as the reference one
      (including its version and the variable name) and selecting the comparison mode. Checking ‘Multiple non-reference
      datasets’ switches on the ‘one validation’ comparison mode.
    </p>
    <div [ngClass]="plotDivClass">
      <p-image alt="datest-configuration" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="datsetConfigurationComparison"
               preview="true" width="100%"></p-image>
    </div>
    <p>
      The Validations selection component gets updated with every change of the reference dataset and shows validations
      available for comparison. A selected validation has to be added by clicking the ‘Add validation’ button.
      If the maximum number of validations has been added, the ‘Add validation’ button gets disabled. Added validations
      are listed below the selection box as red ‘Remove validation’ buttons. Clicking a remove button will remove the
      appropriate validation from the list.
    </p>
    <div [ngClass]="plotDivClass">
      <p-image preview="true" alt="validation-selection" class="scaled_image mb-3"
               [src]="validationSelectionsComparison" width="100%"></p-image>
    </div>
    <p>
      In general it is possible to compare any two validations that have the same reference dataset.
      If additionally the two validations have a common spatial extent, a user can choose if the comparison should be
      performed on all points or only on the common ones. If validations have no common points, the option
      ‘Include all points...’ is disabled.
    </p>
    <div [ngClass]="plotDivClass">
      <p-image preview="true" alt="spatial-extent" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="spatialExtentComparison" width="100%"></p-image>
    </div>
    <p>
      The comparison is started by clicking the ‘Compare’ button. As a result users get four components:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Comparison summary containing summaries, of chosen validations or validation (if ‘one validation’ mode was used);
      </li>
      <li>
        Selected comparison extent containing a plot with marked area for which comparison was performed;
      </li>
      <li>
        Comparison statistics containing a table of validation statistics calculated for both validations and differences
        between them;
      </li>
      <li>
        Comparison plots containing:
        <ul>
          <li>
            a drop down list for metric selection,
          </li>
          <li>
            a box plot depicting particular metric for each validation (if there is no common
            spatial extent between compared validations or if ‘Include all points from the selected validations’ option
            was
            chosen),
          </li>
          <li>
            or a box plot depicting particular metric for each validation and the difference between them, a map depicting
            differences between the chosen metric on all points for which the comparison was performed
            (if there was a common spatial extent between validations).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      All the plots and the statistics table can be downloaded using appropriate buttons placed next to each object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note, that since the comparison module is still being developed and the comparison is done on the fly,
      there is a risk that a particular comparison may not be performed due to too big validation results file.
      If that is the case the user is advised to run smaller (in terms of spatial subsetting) validations and compare them
      one more time.
    </p>

    <a id="user-data-upload"></a>
    <h1 class="h3 mb-3 font-weight-normal">User Data Upload Procedure</h1>
    <p>
      To upload your go to 'My datasets' page, by clicking proper button on the navigation bar.
    </p>
    <div [ngClass]="plotDivClass">
      <p-image preview="true" alt="select-file" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="selectFile" width="100%"></p-image>
    </div>
    <p>
      Click the 'Select file' button, and then choose 'Add file' to add the file you want to upload. Note, that you'll be
      able
      to choose only .netCDF or .zip files, both types need to follow the standard described
      <a target="_blank" [routerLink]="['/user-data-guidelines']">here.</a> If the .zip file you are trying to upload
      contains
      other types of files than .netCDF, .csv or .yml, you will not be able to upload the file. Please note, that you have
      <b> 5GB </b>
      space available for your files. In case you need more, please contact our team.
    </p>
    <div [ngClass]="plotDivClass">
      <p-image preview="true" alt="select-file" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="uploadFileWindow" width="100%"></p-image>
    </div>
    <p>
      When you choose proper file, a form for providing metadata will show up. You need to provide dataset and version
      names.
      Additionally you can introduce display names for both dataset and its version, which is going to be used on the list
      of available datasets.
      If the display name is not provided, the basic name is going to be used.
    </p>
    <div [ngClass]="plotDivClass">
      <p-image preview="true" alt="select-file" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="metadataWindow" width="100%"></p-image>
    </div>
    <p>
      If you want to change file, you can do it by clicking 'Change file' button. If you want to save provided
      information, click 'Save' button.
      Clicking 'Save' button will close the metadata form, but won't start uploading yet. To start uploading, click the
      'Upload file' button.
    </p>
    <div [ngClass]="plotDivClass">
      <p-image preview="true" alt="select-file" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="chosenFile" width="100%"></p-image>
    </div>
    <p>
      Depending on the file size and your upload speed it may take from few seconds up to tens of minutes. You will see a
      blue spinner and information
      about the percentage of uploaded file. Eventually an information will show up that the file has been uploaded, but
      it still needs to be pre-processed.
    </p>
    <div [ngClass]="plotDivClass">
      <p-image preview="true" alt="select-file" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="uploadingSpinner" width="100%"></p-image>
    </div>
    <p>
      When the file gets uploaded and preprocessed, there will show up a row with basic information on the uploaded file.
      You'll be able to change the dataset's name, the version's name and choose a different variable, if the default one
      is inproper or we were not able to retrieve the proper name.
      By clicking 'Remove dataset' button, you will remove the uploaded file. Note, that removing is possible only if the
      uploaded data
      hasn't been used for any validation.
    </p>
    <div [ngClass]="plotDivClass">
      <p-image preview="true" alt="select-file" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="dataRow" width="100%"></p-image>
    </div>

    <p>If you want to use your dataset in a validation, simply go to the Validate page and expand the dataset dropdown
      list. Your dataset will be there.</p>
    <div [ngClass]="plotDivClass">
      <p-image preview="true" alt="select-file" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="userDataOnTheList" width="100%"></p-image>
    </div>
    <p>
      Now you can choose other settings and run a validation. Note that for now it is not possible to publish validation
      that uses private data.
      You can still share your validation with another user, but they won't be able to rerun it, as they don't have access
      to your dataset.
