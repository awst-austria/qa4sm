  <h1 id="validation" class="h3 p-mb-3 font-weight-normal">Validate Page</h1>

  <p>
    The validate page is subdivided into areas for the various validation parameters. Each area has
    menu with two icons on the top right. Hover over the question mark to get help for the respective areas. You can
    use the +/- icon to fold up or fold down the area.
  </p>

    <b>Step 1</b> - Choose the data you would like to validate - including the dataset name, the version of the dataset,
    and one of the soil moisture variables provided in the dataset. All the supported datasets are listed on
    <a routerLink="/datasets" pageScroll="" [pageScrollDuration]="1" target="_blank">datasets page here</a>.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="dataset selection" class="scaled_image" [src]="datasetSelections">
  </div>
  <p>
    <b>Step 2 [optional]</b> - Choose the criteria by which you would like to filter this dataset.
    The filters available depend on the data contained within the chosen dataset. For example,
    you can filter the C3S data to include only data with no inconsistencies detected (flag = 0).
    Details of the filter options provided for each dataset are given on the
    <a routerLink="/datasets" pageScroll="" [pageScrollDuration]="1" target="_blank">supported datasets page</a>. You can also
    hover your mouse pointer over the question mark next to a filter to get a short explanation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Step 3 [optional]</b> - If you want to intercompare several datasets, you can add more datasets to the validation
    using the <b>Add dataset</b> button, up to a maximum of five. Configure the settings for the additional datasets by selecting
    the respective tab and repeating steps 1 and 2 above.<br/>
  </p>
  <p class="alert alert-info">
    <b>Intercomparison:</b> The intercomparison mode of QA4SM validates up to five satellite data sets against a common
    reference data set. For each reference location (e.g. each ISMN station) it finds the nearest observation series in
    all selected satellite products.
    All observations series are then scaled (if selected) and temporally matched to the reference series.
    For validation only the common time stamps (that are available in all satellite products) are used to calculate
    validation metrics
    between the reference and each individual satellite product.
    This way deviations in the metrics due to different temporal coverage are excluded and validation results represent
    differences in
    the performance of the compared satellite products.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="intercomparison" class="scaled_image" [src]="intercomparison">
  </div>
  <p>
    <b>Step 4</b> - Choose the reference dataset you would like to use for the
    validation including the dataset name, the version of the dataset, and the soil moisture variables provided in
    the dataset.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="reference dataset" class="scaled_image" [src]="referenceDatasetSelection">
  </div>
  <p>
    <b>Step 5 [optional]</b> - Choose the criteria by which you would like to filter the reference data prior to
    running the validation. The filters available depend on the data contained within the chosen dataset. For example,
    you can filter the ISMN data to include only data points where the soil_moisture_flag is &quot;G&quot; for &quot;good&quot;.
    You can also hover your mouse pointer over the question mark next to a filter
    to get a short explanation. <br>
    <span style="color: red">
    If the reference dataset is ISMN you can also choose specific networks and/or measurements in a defined depth range.
    To do that you have to open an appropriate window by clicking a 'select...' link next to the filter you want to parameterised.
    </span>
  </p>
  <img  alt='ismn networks' class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="ismnNetworks">
  <p style="color: red">
    The window for choosing networks contains a list of continents. When clicking a continent name a list of networks that belong to the continent unfolds.
    Next to each network there is the name of the country it belongs to. To toggle the particular network it is enough to click on its name.
    The choice has to be approved by clicking the 'Use networks' button.
  </p>
  <img alt="ismn depths" class="scaled_image mb-3" [src]="ismnDepths">
  <p>
    <span style="color: red">
    The window for the depth selection contains two fields for introducing the depth range.
    Again, the choice has to be accepted by clicking the 'Use depth range' button.
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Details of the filter options provided for each dataset are given on the supported datasets page
    <a routerLink="/datasets">here</a>. You can also hover your mouse pointer over the question mark next to a filter
    to get a short explanation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Step 6 [optional]</b> - If you want to calculate metrics from anomalies instead of absolute values, select the
    desired method
    in the &quot;Method&quot; drop-down menu. The options are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not calculate: don't calculate anomalies, use absolute values.</li>
    <li>35 day moving average: calculate the differences between each measurement value and the 35 day moving average
      around the value.
    </li>
    <li>Climatology: calculate the differences between each measurement value and the climatology value for that day of
      the year. The climatology
      is calculated producing an average for each day of the year across the input dataset over the given climatology
      period. You have to specify
      which years to use for climatology calculation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div>
    <img alt="anomalies" class="scaled_image p-mb-3" [src]="anomalies">
  </div>
  <p>
    <b>Step 7 [optional]</b> - Chose the geographic area over which the validation should be performed. You can either
    specify a lat/lon bounding
    box directly or you can select the area on a map. The trash button will clear all four
    bounding
    box fields.<br/>
    If you don't specify an area, a global validation will be done.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="spatial subsetting" class="scaled_image p-mb-3" [src]="spatialSubsetting">
    <img alt="map selection" class="scaled_image p-mb-3" [src]="mapSelection">
  </div>
  <p>
    <b>Step 8 [optional]</b> - Choose the date range over which the validation should be performed. Accepted formats
    are: YYYY*MM*DD
    or DD*MM*YYYY where * can be any of &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot; or &quot;-&quot;. If you leave the fields empty, the validation period
    will be
    implicitly determined through temporal matching of the data and reference selected. For the time range covered by
    the various
    datasets, see the <a routerLink="/datasets" pageScroll="" [pageScrollDuration]="1" target="_blank">datasets page</a>.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="validation period" class="scaled_image p-mb-3" [src]="validationPeriod">
  </div>
  <p>
    <b>Step 9 [optional]</b> - Activate Triple Collocation Analysis (TC) and Bootstrapping Triple Collocation confidence intervals (BTC). By default, QA4SM calculates validation
    metrics between dataset pairs (the reference and each candidate data set). If more than 3 datasets
    are selected (including the reference), the switch to activate TC becomes available. If
    TC is selected, in addition to the basic metrics between dataset pairs, TC metrics between
    triples of selected datasets are calculated. The reference is included in all triples and
    metrics are found for all candidate datasets. Note that each TC metric is specific to a dataset
    (this is evident from the metric name). TC metrics are affected by all 3 used datasets. Only results from TC with
    independent datasets should be used. <br><br>
    The bootstrapping option is enabled only if TC is selected.
    When it is chosen confidence intervals are calculated via bootstrapping with 1000 repetitions, however the validation time might be up to 5 times longer.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="triple collocation" class="scaled_image p-mb-3" [src]="tca">
  </div>

  <p>
    <b>Step 10</b> - Choose how the data (or reference) will be scaled before metrics calculation.
    The data can be scaled to the reference (default) or vice versa.
    Note that in an intercomparision validation (with multiple datasets), only scaling to reference
    is possible.
    The scaling method determines how values of one dataset are mapped onto the value range of the
    other dataset for better comparability.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="scaling" class="scaled_image p-mb-3" [src]="scaling">
  </div>

  <p>
    <b>Step 11</b> - Optionally name your validation results to make it easier to identify it in
    the list of all your validations.
  </p>
  <div>
    <img alt="name your validation" class="scaled_image p-mb-3" [src]="nameYourValidation">
  </div>
  <p>
    <b>Step 12</b> - Run the validation process. You'll be notified via e-mail once it's
    finished. You don't need to keep the results window (or even your browser) open for
    the validation to run. The email will contain a link to your results.
